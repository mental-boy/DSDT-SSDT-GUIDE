# DSDT ERROR (alienware)
- Now I am assuming that you have MacIasl as well as RehabMan Laptop patches
- After that open DSDT.dsl with Maciasl and apply ADBG fix
- now there are 2 error see this how to remove them
- look this is the error line
      Method (GOPS, 1, NotSerialized)
            {
                Store (Zero, CDSP)
                If (CondRefOf (HDSE))
                {
                    Store (HDSE)
                    CDSP
                }
                Else
                {
                    GETD ()
                }

                Return (CDSP)
            }

            Method (SOPS, 1, NotSerialized)
            {
                If (CondRefOf (HDSE))
                {
                    HDSE
                    Arg0
                }
                Else
                {
                    SETD (Arg0)
                }

                Return (Zero)
            }
- For Resolve it


             Method (GOPS, 1, NotSerialized)

                {
                    GETD ()


                Return (CDSP)
            }

            Method (SOPS, 1, NotSerialized)

                Else
                {
                    SETD (Arg0)


                Return (Zero)
            }

- Now there is one error left
- ` Add (Local0, 0x02)`
- remove it means delete it and you have no error left it is good to go save as .dsl now you are able to patch
